    "\n",
    "The friendship paradox is an interesting phenomenon that highlights a disparity between an individual's perception of their own popularity and the average popularity of their friends. In simple terms, the friendship paradox states that, on average, your friends will have more friends than you do. This may seem counterintuitive at first, as we tend to believe that we are just as popular as our friends. However, when we consider from network perspective, it becomes clear why this paradox exists.\n",
