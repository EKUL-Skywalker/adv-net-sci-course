    "### Computing the structural features\n",
    "Link prediction is essentially a binary classification task, where you are given a set of node pairs, and your task is to *classify* them into connected and unconnected node pairs. Your classification must be based on *features* of the node pairs that characterize the structure around the node pair. For instance, one can consider degrees of nodes $i$ and $j$, and/or the number of common neighbors, as a feature of the node pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/_images/25.01.03-representation_of_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, one will encode the structural features of node pairs as a single matrix $X$, where each row describes the feature of a node pair. You also have a target vector $y$, which is a value you want to output based on the feature vector. In link prediction, our target is absence/presence of edges, so $y$ is vector of binary variables. The link predictor is a function $f$ that predicts $y$ from $X$, i.e.,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat y := f(X)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and we want to train $f$ such that its output aligns with the target $y$, i.e., $y\\sim \\hat y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting data into train and test data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless ways to design predictor $f$. One option is to design the function yourself, while another is to utilize machine learning to train a predictive function $f$. Regardless of the approach, it is crucial to have *test data* to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of your prediction function $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test data should be independent of the training data. In link prediction task, data are a set of edges, so we put aside some edges for testing (test edge set), and train the link predictor with the remaining edges (i.e., training edge set)."

    "Improved? You can add any structural features by redefining the compute_feature_vectors function.

One effective approach is to visualize the network, identify patterns, quantify them, and utilize them as structural features for prediction. This process often yields valuable insights.\n",
