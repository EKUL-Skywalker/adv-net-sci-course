    "In this assignment, we will follow the work conducted by Moreno and Jennings in 1938 on the topic of [\"Statistics of social configurations\"](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2785588). Their research focused on exploring the differences between interesting structures in social networks and random connections. They are credited with developing one of the first models for random networks. We will follow their experiment, with a similar but different data.\n",

    "The data is a network of seventh grade students in Victoria, Australia. The students were asked to nominated classmates about who gets on with in the class. Each edge is directed from $i$ to $j$, which represents that student $i$ nominates student $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is modified for this exercise. Some edges are removed such that each student has three nominated friends. In the original data, each student nominates more than three friends, and the data contains two other networks on different activities, i.e., who are your best friends, and who would you prefer to work with.
