    "\n",
    "Let's prepare your laboratory for network data science. You have two options, local environment or cloud service. Setting a local environment requires some initial work, but once set up successfully, you have more flexibility and options. So, I'd highly encourage to try setting up the local environment. If you feel it tedious, you can use a cloud service like Google Colab. Follow the instruction below to set up your lab environment."
