I recommend starting with igraph or networkx since you have more control over the calculation and produce reproduceable results."

    "`networkx` is a Python package that offers a user-friendly interface. It is primarily written in Python, making it simple to install and modify. However, one drawback is that it is slow, particularly when dealing with large networks. Additionally, `networkx` may not faithfully implement certain algorithms, which raises concerns about its reliability. Despite its widespread usage, I do not recommend using this package for these reasons.\n",

    "#### How to create a color map with Python\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "cmap = sns.color_palette() # a preconfigured color palette (tab10 with saturation) in seaborn. There are many other color palettes in seaborn. See its documentation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "To specify node colors in `igraph`, you need to create a 1D array of length equal to the number of nodes. Each element in the array (say `node_color`) contains the color of the node. For instance, you can specify the color of $i$th node to be `red` by\n",
    "```python\n",
    "node_color[i] = \"#ff0000\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you created the array, pass it to `igraph.plot` with argument `vertex_color`, e.g.,\n",

    "    bbox=(700,700) #bounding box\n",
    ") # plot API. You may want to reduce the size of nodes, and change layout algorithm etc.\n",
