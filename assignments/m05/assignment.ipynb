    "# Network visualization\n",
    "In this assignment, you will visualize a network. You have the flexibility to choose any visualization tool. But here are some suggestions for the tools:\n",
    "- [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/tutorial/0.9.6/visualisation.html)\n",
    "- [graph_tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/)\n",
    "- [networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)\n",
    "- [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)\n",
    "- [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of visualization tools depends on whether the visualization is exploratory or explanatory. Exploratory visualization is used for generating hypotheses, while explanatory visualization aims to demonstrate focal patterns in data. A powerful visualization can serve both purposes. Gephi and Cytoscape are good options for exploratory visualization as they offer interactive visualizations. Other tools lean more towards explanatory visualization, and provides a greater level of customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my personal opinion, Gephi and Cytoscape offer interactive visualizations with a GUI interface. However, these tools require manual configurations and may not be ideal if you need to create multiple visualizations. I personally prefer `igraph` and `graph_tool` as they are scalable, generate beautiful vector images, and offer highly customizable visualizations.\n",
