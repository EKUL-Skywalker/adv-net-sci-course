    "# Friendship paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your friends have more friends than you do\" on average is an interesting phenomenon that highlights a disparity between an individual's perception of their own popularity and the average popularity of their friends. This may seem counterintuitive at first, as we tend to believe that we are just as popular as our friends. However, when we consider from network perspective, it becomes clear why this paradox exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will confirm the friendship paradox in a social network. Through this exercise, we will learn how to define and construct a network from non-network data and how to represent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preprocessing\n",

    "Networks appear virtually every corner of the world. But these networks may not explicitly appear in data. As we will see, most data a *collection of observations.* It's your task to define and construct nodes and edges from the collection.\n",

    "Let's see a raw data about social network, i.e., [Copenhagen Network study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0325-x). This study collected data about physical proximities of about 700 students measured based on Bluetooth signals with smartphone. Our dataset is a subset of the original dataset, and I replaced the student IDs with randomly generated names.
