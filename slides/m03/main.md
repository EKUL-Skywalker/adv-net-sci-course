<div style="font-size:22pt;margin-top:-5%">

1. You will start up a social networking service and want to attract popular people to promote your service. Which of the following approaches is more likely to attract popular people as users? Explain why from the perspective of the friendship paradox.
   - **Waiting list**: Anyone can sign up for a waiting list and join the service on a first-come-first-served basis.
   - **Invitation**: Users can invite a given number of new users.

2. Create the Compressed Sparse Row Format of the undirected and unweighted network shown below with three arrays `indptr`, `indices` and `data`.

### Let's test the Friendship paradox

Average \# of friends
$$
(1 + 3 + 2 + 2)/4 = 2
$$
Average \# of friends *a friend has*
$$
(\underbrace{1}_{\text{Abby}} + \underbrace{3 +3 + 3}_{\text{Becca}} +  \underbrace{2 + 2}_{\text{Chloe}} + \underbrace{2 +2}_{\text{Deb}}) / 8 = 2.25
$$

# The friendship paradox is a ***mathematical*** fact

It is always true unless everyone has an equal number of friends.

**Why?**:
Popular individuals appear frequently in someone's friend list.

### ... and beyond an interesting piece of trivia

- Why is word-of-mouth an effective marketing strategy?

- Why can an infectious disease spread so quickly  ü¶†?

- Why is the snow-ball sampling biased?

You will start up a social networking service and want to attract popular people to promote your service. Which of the following approaches is more likely to attract popular people as users? Explain why from the perspective of the friendship paradox.
   - **Waiting list**: Anyone can sign up for a waiting list and join the service on a first-come-first-served basis.
   - **Invitation**: Users can invite a given number of new users.

**Answer**: The invitation-based approach is considered more effective as it takes advantage of the friendship paradox, which means that popular individuals are more likely to receive invitations through social contacts.

<div style="font-size:25pt;margin-top:-5%">

First of all, let's create the adjacency list:

<center>

![bg width:100% right:30%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/800px-6n-graf.svg.png)

</center>

```
{
  1: [2,5],
  2: [1,3,5],
  3: [2,4],
  4: [3,5,6],
  5: [1,2,4],
  6: [4],
}
```

Then, create the CSR representation:
```
indices = [2,5,1,3,5,2,4,3,5,6,1,2,4,4]
indptr = [0,2,5,7,10,13,14]
data = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

</div>

---

- **Pros üôÇ**
  - Space efficient
    - Only takes $2m$ values, where $m$ is the number of non-zero entries.
  - Time efficient
    - Matrix product scales *linearly* by $m$ for sparse matrix üöÄ
    - Dense matrix scales with $n^2$ ($n$ = \# of nodes).
  - Efficient format for parallel computing

## What are the *cons ü§î?*

---

- **Cons ü•≤**
  - Changes to the network structure are expensive.
    - E.g., Adding/deleting an edge requires to compile from scratch.
  - CSR is slow in column slicing, e.g.,
    ```
    A[1, :] # Row slicing is fast
    A[:, 1] # Column slicing is slow
    ```
  - CSC is slow in *row* slicing

---

- **Edge table**
  - üôÇ Portable & Space efficient. ü•≤ Inconvenient for computing
- **Adjacency matrix**
  - üôÇ Convenient for computing and math. ü•≤ Space inefficient.
- **Adjacency list**
  - üôÇ Space efficient. Efficient access to *local* structure. ü•≤ Not convenient for computing *global* stats.
- **Compressed Sparse Row/Columns**
  - üôÇ Space and Time efficient. ü•≤ Not flexible to changes in the structure.
- **Others**. COOrdinate, List of List, etc.

### Adjacency matrix

- ...is a matrix representing a network
- The rows and columns represent the nodes
- Entry $A_{ij}$ indicates the presence ($A_{ij}=1$) or absence ($A_{ij}=0$) of an edge between nodes $i$ and $j.$

### Exercise

<div class="container">
<div class="col" >

- Create the adjacency matrix for the edge table on the right.
  - Make an 11x11 grid
  - Place 1 at an entry where $A_{ij}=1$
  - You can omit marking $A_{ij}=0$

- Think about the pros and cons

- \# of edges in the network
- \# of friends (i.e., degree) of node $i$.
- \# of common friends between nodes $i$ and $j$Ô∏è
- Average number of friends
- Average number of friends that a friend has

- \# of edges $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}$ or $\frac{1}{2}{\bf 1}^\top A {\bf 1}$

  - Row sum, i.e., $\sum_{j}A_{ij}$, or $(A \cdot {\bf 1})_i$
- \# of common friends between nodes $i$ and $j$Ô∏è
  - $(i,j)$th entry of a squared matrix, i.e., $\sum_{k}A_{ik}A_{jk}$
  - or $(A^2)_{ij}$
- Average number of friends
  - $\sum_{ij} A_{ij}/n$ (where $n$ = \# of nodes) or ${\bf 1}^\top A {\bf 1}/n$,

### The friendship paradox is a ***mathematical*** fact

![bg right:36% 100%](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/06/opinion/strogatz2-fig1/strogatz2-fig1-blog427.jpg)

It holds true for any network unless everyone has an equal number of friends.

**Why?**
Popular individuals appear frequently in someone's friend list.
E.g., a person with one friend is counted as a friend with one friend once. But a person with 100 friends is counted as a friend with 100 friends 100 times.

1. Write the adjacency list
2. Represent it by the three arrays---*indices*, *indptr* and *data*---in the CSR representation
3. Compute the degree of node 2 using the *indptr*.

Hint:
-  Adjacency list = $\{\underbrace{\text{key}}_{\text{row ID}}: \underbrace{\text{values}}_{\substack{\text{non-zero entries'} \\ \text{column IDs}}}\}$
- **indices** concatenates `values` arrays:
  - indices = [`1`, `2,10`,`1,3,10`,`2,4,5,6`]
- **indptr** = the partition between different `values` arrays.
  - indptr = [0,1,3,6,10]

# Python

Check out  [scipy.sparse.csr\_matrix ‚Äî SciPy v1.11.2 Manual](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.csr_matrix)


```python
from scipy import sparse

src = [0,2,3,4,5]
trg = [5,3,1,5,6]
entry_values = [1,3,1,4,3]
A=sparse.csr_matrix((entry_values, (src, trg)), shape=(7,7))

A # 7x7 *sparse* matrix (CSR format)

A @ A # You can take its product just like a matrix
```

- **Compressed Sparse Column format (CSC)**:
  - Consists of *indices*, *indptr*, *data* (same as CSR)
  - *data* is the values of non-zero entries (same as CSR)
  - *indptr* is a pointer for *indices* (same as CSR)
  - *indices* = IDs of non-zero ***row IDs***
  - Equivalent to a *CSR representation of the transposed matrix*

- Implemented in `scipy` üòâ

---

- **Pros üôÇ**
  - Space efficient
    - Only takes $2m$ values, where $m$ is the number of non-zero entries.
  - Time efficient
    - Matrix product scales *linearly* by $m$ for sparse matrix üöÄ
    - Dense matrix scales with $n^2$ ($n$ = \# of nodes).
  - Efficient format for parallel computing

## What are the *cons ü§î?*

---

- **Cons ü•≤**
  - Changes to the network structure are expensive.
    - E.g., Adding/deleting an edge requires to compile from scratch.
  - CSR is slow in column slicing, e.g.,
    ```
    A[1, :] # Row slicing is fast
    A[:, 1] # Column slicing is slow
    ```
  - CSC is slow in *row* slicing

---

- **Edge table**
  - üôÇ Portable & Space efficient. ü•≤ Inconvenient for computing
- **Adjacency matrix**
  - üôÇ Convenient for computing and math. ü•≤ Space inefficient.
- **Adjacency list**
  - üôÇ Space efficient. Efficient access to *local* structure. ü•≤ Not convenient for computing *global* stats.
- **Compressed Sparse Row/Columns**
  - üôÇ Space and Time efficient. ü•≤ Not flexible to changes in the structure.
- **Others**. COOrdinate, List of List, etc.
