<div style="font-size:20pt;margin-top:-5%">

1. You will start up a social networking service and want to attract popular people to promote your service. Which of the following approaches is more likely to attract popular people as users? Explain why from the perspective of the friendship paradox.
   - **Waiting list**: Anyone can sign up for a waiting list and join the service on a first-come-first-served basis.
   - **Invitation**: Users can invite a given number of new users.

2. Create the Compressed Sparse Row Format of the undirected and unweighted network shown below with three arrays `indptr`, `indices` and `data`.

### Let's test the Friendship paradox

Average \# of friends
$$
(1 + 3 + 2 + 2)/4 = 2
$$
Average \# of friends *a friend has*
$$
(\underbrace{1}_{\text{Abby}} + \underbrace{3 +3 + 3}_{\text{Becca}} +  \underbrace{2 + 2}_{\text{Chloe}} + \underbrace{2 +2}_{\text{Deb}}) / 8 = 2.25
$$

## The friendship paradox is a ***mathematical*** fact

It is always true unless everyone has an equal number of friends.

**Why?**:
Popular individuals appear frequently in someone's friend list.

   - **Waiting list**: Anyone can sign up for a waiting list and join the service on a first-come-first-served basis.
   - **Invitation**: Users can invite a given number of new users.

**Answer**: The invitation-based approach is considered more effective as it takes advantage of the friendship paradox, which means that popular individuals are more likely to receive invitations through social contacts.

# <center style="margin-top:80px"> Why ü§î?</center>


---

<div style="font-size:22pt;margin-top:-5%">

First of all, let's create the adjacency list:

<center>

![bg width:100% right:30%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/800px-6n-graf.svg.png)

</center>

```
{
  1: [2,5],
  2: [1,3,5],
  3: [2,4],
  4: [3,5,6],
  5: [1,2,4],
  6: [4],
}
```

Then, create the CSR representation:
```
indices = [2,5,1,3,5,2,4,3,5,6,1,2,4,4]
indptr = [0,2,5,7,10,13,14]
data = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

</div>

- **ProsüôÇ**
  - Space efficient
    - Only takes $2m$ values, where $m$ is the number of non-zero entries.
  - Time efficient
    - Matrix product scales *linearly* by $m$ for sparse matrix üöÄ
    - Dense matrix scales with $n^2$ ($n$ = \# of nodes).
  - Efficient format for parallel computing

What are the *cons ü§î?*

---

- **Cons ü•≤**
  - Changes to the network structure are expensive.
    - E.g., Adding/deleting an edge requires to compile from scratch.
  - CSR is slow in column slicing, e.g.,
    ```
    A[1, :] # Row slicing is fast
    A[:, 1] # Column slicing is slow
    ```
  - CSC is slow in *row* slicing

---

<div style="font-size:28px">

- **Edge table**
  - üôÇ Portable & Space efficient. ü•≤ Inconvenient for computing
- **Adjacency matrix**
  - üôÇ Convenient for computing and math. ü•≤ Space inefficient.
- **Adjacency list**
  - üôÇ Space efficient. Efficient access to *local* structure. ü•≤ Not convenient for computing *global* stats.
- **Compressed Sparse Row/Columns**
  - üôÇ Space and Time efficient. ü•≤ Not flexible to changes in the structure.
- **Others**. COOrdinate, List of List, etc.

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Always specify the data types:

```
import pandas as pd

contact_data_table = pd.read_csv(
    filename,
    dtype={
        "user_a": str,
        "user_b": str,
        "rssi": int,
        "#timestamp": int,

### <center > Two types of measurements of edges </center>

- **Direct**:
  - e.g., ask people for their friends to identify friendship ties.
- **Indirect (inferential)**:
  - e.g., consider two people having a friendship tie if they hang out together frequently.
  - *Most networks are this type*.

Let's focus on the indirect measurement of edges.
