# About this dataset 

This dataset represents a global airport network, where two airports are considered connected if there is at least one scheduled commercial flight between them. The data source for this dataset can be found at

  https://openflights.org/data.html
  
The dataset is organized into two tables: node_table.csv and edge_table.csv. The node_table.csv contains the airport IDs along with their respective attributes, which are derived from the original data (please refer to the original data for more information on the metadata). The edge_table.csv contains pairs of airport IDs that are directly connected in the network.
