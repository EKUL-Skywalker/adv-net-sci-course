# About this dataset 

This is a worldwide airport network, in which two airports are connected if there is at least one scheduled commercial flight between them. The source data is taken from 

  [http://opsahl.co.uk/tnet/datasets/openflights.txt](https://openflights.org/data.html)

The network is compiled as two tables, node_table.csv and edge_table.csv. The node_table.csv contains the airport IDs together with the aiports' attributes taken from the original data (see the original data about the metadata). 
The edge table.csv contains the pairs of the IDs of airports that are directly connected.
